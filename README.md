# PacMen 

## This exercise is fun and interactive code that allows you to fill the screen with PacMen and let them run rampant across the screen. I also added some css to my html file to give it more color!

### How it works: Open the index.html file in a browser window, push on the button says "Add a PacMan" and than press "Start Munching". You can continue to add more and more pacmen and watch them bounce around! How many can you keep track of at once?? Give it try! 

#### Future improvements would include having all 4 images of PacMen come out of the "Add a PacMan" button... or maybe use a gif type image instead?? Also when you add your PacMen, sometimes it will generate right on top of the buttons... hence, you cannot push them... So I would improve that as well. I also would add a "reset" button so that you don't have to refresh the page if you want to put all the PacMen away or startover.
